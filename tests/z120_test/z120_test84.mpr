/******************************************************
Example of bMSC where two events have the same name (incomplete input message)

parser takes message label e0; in a,0 from NAME2; and wait for second part of the message
ignores  label e0; in a,0 from NAME2; due to the same name of the event
ignores  label e0; in a,0 from found before e1; due to the same name of the event

ignores  label e0; out a,0 to NAME1; due to the same name of the event
at the end parser recognize that the message label e0; in a,0 from NAME2; has only one part
prints warning and modifies the message to label e0; in a,0 from found;
