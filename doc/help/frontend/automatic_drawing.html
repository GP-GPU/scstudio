      Automatic drawing
    </h1>
    <p>
      With all required shapes available in the BMSC and HMSC stencils, it is
      possible to draw virtually any MSC diagram. In practice, there are many
      stereotypes, however. SCStudio helps the user draw some frequently used
      patterns by several automatic drawing functions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="add_instances">
      Add Instances
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first of them is the <code>Add Instances</code> function
      accessible via menu <code>Check &#8594; Drawing &#8594; Add Instances</code>,
      or <code>Ctrl+Alt+F</code> keyboard shortcut. It is available in
      the context (right-click) menu of the document, too. The function draws a
      given number of instances on the active page of the document, with
      constant or dynamic space between each two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When invoked, the following dialog appears:
    </p>
    <img class="big" src="pictures/add_instances_options.png"
    alt="Add Instances options dialog" />
    <p>
      The first two fields set the number of instances to be drawn and their
      length. Next two fields set the starting point from which to start
      drawing. If the cursor was in the document drawing area in the time of Add
      Instances invocation (that is, the keyboard shortcut or context-menu was
      used), the start position fields are filled with the cursor position, i.e.
      drawing will start from the point where the cursor was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Options panel, if the Total width switch is chosen, all the
      instances will be drawn in the place of a width given, so the gaps between
      instances will be calculated to fit this area. On the contrary, the
      Spacing switch sets constant gaps between the instances not limiting the
      total width.
    </p>
    <p>
      All numbers in the dialog are in units of the current page of the
      document.
    </p>
    <h2 id="message_sequence">
      Message Sequence
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Message Sequence function draws a sequence of messages among selected
      instances. The basic usage is that when one instance sends a message,
      which is received and resent by several other instances and finally
      received by the last instance, as illustrated in the following picture.
    </p>
    <img src="pictures/message_sequence.png" alt="Message Sequence example" />
    <p>
      The Message Sequence function is accessible via menu <code>Check &#8594;
      Drawing &#8594; Message Sequence</code>, or <code>Ctrl+Alt+S</code>
      keyboard shortcut or <code>Message Sequence</code> context-menu
      on instances. As for other automatic drawing functions, an options dialog
      is opened after Message Sequence invocation:
    </p>
    <img class="big" src="pictures/message_sequence_options.png"
    alt="Message Sequence options dialog" />
    <p>
      The first option in the dialog determines the direction of the sequence.
      For each direction, a separate message label may be specified in the Left
      and Right Message Captions input boxes. Uni- and bidirectional message
      sequences are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting Y-position determines the instances, among which the sequence is
      to be drawn. The initial set of instances is taken according to current
      selection:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        if there are no instances selected, all instances on the page are taken;
      </li>
      <li>
        if there is exactly one instance selected, then SCStudio waits for
        another instance to be selected;
      </li>
      <li>
        otherwise, all selected instances are taken into account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    From all of these instances, the leftmost and the rightmost instances are
    recognized as the first and last instance in the message sequence. Between
    these two, all other instances crossing an imaginary horizontal line at
    height equal to Starting Y-position are qualified for the message sequence.
    (During the options dialog, these two instances are marked with red color.)
    <p>
      The Starting Y-position has a default value of mouse position, so the most
      comfortable way of invoking Message Sequence is using the context-menu on
      the first instance at the point where the sequence should start, followed
      by selecting the last instance, to which the sequence shall come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two input boxes, Vertical space between messages and Vertical
      space between left and right sequence define the vertical space between to
      subsequent messages on the same instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last options group determines treatment of coregions found in the way
      of the message sequence. Such a situation may be forbidden (by the first
      choice in the dialog) or ignored (the second choice - the incident
      messages are simply attached to the coregion without any order), or the
      messages passing through a coregion may be ordered by ordering line or
      side-side ordering.
